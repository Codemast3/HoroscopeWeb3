## Heya folks! 🚀

Today, I’ll guide you through building your very first **Web3** application and even **ship** it! 🎉

### 🎯 **What are we building?**

We’re going to create a **React** app that:
- **Takes the user’s date of birth**.
- **Connects their Metamask wallet**.
- **Mints an NFT** directly to their address!



### 🔥 **Why this project?**

This project will show you how an app can interact with a deployed smart contract. Once you're familiar with the flow, **the sky is the limit** for the apps you can build!

### 💡 **Possible App Ideas:**
- A **Harry Potter quiz** app that tells you which Hogwarts House you belong to!
- A quiz app to see if you're a **BTS Army** (I love BTS!! 💜).
- The famous **13 personality test** app.
  
With this knowledge, you’ll be able to create **unique** and **fun** Web3 apps that interact with smart contracts. You can even launch them and let users try them out!

### 🎉 **Course Overview:**

In this project, we will:
- Cover **awesome tools** needed for smart contract interaction.
- Build your **first Web3 application**.
- **Mint NFTs** via the app.
- Learn to interact with a **deployed smart contract**.
- Connect **Metamask** to the app.
- **Ship** the app to a testnet and **interact** with it.

### 🛠 **Tools & Technologies:**

- **React.js** for the frontend.
- **Ethers.js** to interact with Ethereum.
- **Metamask** for wallet connection.
- **Infura API** to connect with the Ethereum network.
- **Polygon Mumbai Testnet** for deploying the contract.

### 🚀 **Let’s Start Building!**

This is gonna be so cool, and I’m super excited to see the amazing projects you create. Ready? Let’s bring your A-game!
